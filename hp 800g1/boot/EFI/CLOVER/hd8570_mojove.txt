Hello, I've been working on an hackintosh for a year now and since then I had my old GeForce 8400 die so I decide to get the r7 240, I knew it wasn't support in Mac OS so I found away to get it working with no lag.

 

On clover configurator goto devices->fake id then in the ati box type 0x67981002

 

Next goto Graphics->inject->ATI=true

Next type in FBname which is Eulemur

 

If you can

Enable inject ECID

PATCH VIDEO BIOS

video ports=3
